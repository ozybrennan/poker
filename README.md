# poker

A game of poker for the console. Players can raise and fold. The game automatically calculates the value of players' hands; the code is DRYed out using "flush" and "straight" methods. This poker game was created using TDD.  

Unfortunately, some of the strategy is missing because players can see each others' hands.
